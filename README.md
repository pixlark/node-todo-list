`server.js` is the nodejs script that runs the server on
port 3000. `/www/html` is the outward-facing client data that should
be placed in the appropriate directory for your web server. The web
server itself should be set up to proxy requests to the `/api`
subdomain to port 3000 so that this server can do it's thing.
